		Hamid Ismailov deserves an apology. Or at the very least, an explanation.</p>
		It has been 26 years since the events that led Uzbek journalist Ismailov to leave his home country of Uzbekistan. In the 1990s, Ismailov was working with a BBC television crew to make a film about Uzbekistan. The repressive regime in power under Islam Karimov opened a criminal case against Ismailov. The authorities said Ismailov was trying to overthrow the government.</p>
		Friends advised Ismailov to flee Uzbekistan after threats against his family and attacks on his home. So he did. A quarter-century later, he still hasn’t been back.
		That’s not for lack of trying. Ismailov attempted to go back as recently as last year after the death of Karimov in 2016. He was denied entry.
		One of the most widely published Uzbek writers in the world, Ismailov’s books are banned in his home country. Mentions of Ismailov are not tolerated. His existence has essentially been erased from the daily cultural life of his homeland. However, in the age of the internet, Ismailov has found ways to reach the Uzbek audience through social media. He posts his novels to Facebook where Uzbeks can read them.
